# Cancer-AI
## Introduction 
Cancer-AI is a computational platform developed for in silico profiling of activating mutations of kinases. The particular dataset used in this example focuses on mutations found in the tyrosine kinase domain of the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK). Cancer-AI was developed in the Radhakrishnan Lab (https://fling.seas.upenn.edu/~biophys/dynamic/wordpress/) at the University of Pennsylvania.
