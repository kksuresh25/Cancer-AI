# Cancer-AI
## Introduction 
Cancer-AI is a computational platform developed for in silico profiling of activating mutations of kinases. Our platform is able to robostly predict the activating behavior of uncharacterized mutations found in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of kinases implicated in cancer. The particular dataset used in this example focuses on mutations found in the TKD of the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK). Cancer-AI was developed in the Radhakrishnan Lab (https://fling.seas.upenn.edu/~biophys/dynamic/wordpress/) at the University of Pennsylvania. 

## Set-up 
Before getting started, please check the `requirements.txt` to ensure that the correct version of Python packages are installed on your local machine. 

There are four folders in the directory: 

1. SVM 
2. Logistic Regression
3. Neural Network
4. Random Forest 

Each folder contains code for the implementation of each AI algorthm.
